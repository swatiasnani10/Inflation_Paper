We use novel survey data on Indian households to evaluate the contribution of inflation targeting in anchoring inflation expectations. The novel feature of the database; viz., its availability before and after the adoption of inflation targeting by the Reserve Bank of India in 2015 allows us to compare the evolution of household inflation ex- pectations relative to inflation dynamics during these two periods. Our results show that householdsâ€™ expectations of consumer price inflation, which were not anchored before the switch to inflation targeting, become so after the switch, not only in the aggregate, but also in the two major components, food and non-food. Importantly, we find that it is the lower spillover from persistently volatile food inflation to both food and non-food inflation expectations after 2015 that explains improved price sta- bility performance and anchoring of household inflation expectations after the switch to inflation targeting.
